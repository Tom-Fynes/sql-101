# SQL 101

The SQL 101 course is designed for someone aspiring to build a career as data engineer, analyst, or  a data scientist. This course covers fundamental SQL concepts, including querying, database design, and data manipulation. learning to extract insights and support data-driven decision-making.

By the end of the course, you will be writing complex queries, optimizing database performance, and using SQL to solve practical problems.

## Grades

Grades have been added to help break your journy into helpful sections. Each section will cover different skill levels and will help you demonstrate your ability to other people.

### Grade 1: Introduction to SQL and Databases

- **Overview of SQL**: What is SQL, history, and its importance.
* **Relational Databases**: Basic concepts of relational databases, tables, rows, and columns.
* **Basic SQL Syntax**: Introduction to SQL statements and query structure.
* **Simple Queries**: Using `SELECT` to retrieve data from a single table.
* **Filtering Data**: Using `WHERE` clause to filter results.

### Grade 2: Intermediate Data Retrieval

- **Sorting Data**: Using `ORDER BY` to sort query results.
* **Limiting Results**: Using `LIMIT` (or `TOP` in some SQL dialects) to restrict the number of returned rows.
* **Basic Functions**: Introduction to SQL functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.
* **Aliasing**: Using `AS` to rename columns in the result set.

### Grade 3: Advanced Data Retrieval

- **Joins**: Understanding and using different types of joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`).
* **Aggregate Functions**: Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and filtering groups with `HAVING`.
* **Subqueries**: Writing and using subqueries in `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and `HAVING` clauses.
* **Set Operations**: Using `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.

### Grade 4: Data Manipulation

- **Inserting Data**: Using `INSERT` to add new records to a table.
* **Updating Data**: Using `UPDATE` to modify existing records.
* **Deleting Data**: Using `DELETE` to remove records.
* **Bulk Operations**: Performing bulk inserts, updates, and deletes.

### Grade 5: Database Design and Data Definition

- **Creating Tables**: Using `CREATE TABLE` to define new tables.
* **Altering Tables**: Using `ALTER TABLE` to modify existing tables (e.g., adding, dropping columns).
* **Dropping Tables**: Using `DROP TABLE` to delete tables.
* **Constraints**: Understanding and implementing primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.

### Grade 6: Advanced SQL Functions and Expressions

- **String Functions**: Using functions like `CONCAT`, `SUBSTRING`, `LENGTH`, `TRIM`, etc.
* **Date and Time Functions**: Using functions like `NOW`, `DATEADD`, `DATEDIFF`, `FORMAT`, etc.
* **Mathematical Functions**: Using functions like `ROUND`, `ABS`, `CEIL`, `FLOOR`, etc.
* **Case Statements**: Using `CASE` for conditional logic within queries.

### Grade 7: Performance Tuning and Optimization

- **Indexes**: Understanding the importance of indexes and how to create them.
* **Query Optimization**: Tips and techniques for writing efficient queries.
* **Execution Plans**: Reading and interpreting execution plans to optimize query performance.
* **Temporary Tables and CTEs**: Using temporary tables and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex queries.

### Grade 8: Transactions and Security

- **Transactions**: Using `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` to manage transactions.
* **Locking and Concurrency**: Understanding locking mechanisms and how to handle concurrency.
* **User Management**: Creating and managing users, roles, and permissions.
* **Security Best Practices**: Implementing best practices for securing SQL databases, including SQL injection prevention.
