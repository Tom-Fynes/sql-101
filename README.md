# SQL 101

The SQL 101 course is designed for someone aspiring to build a career as data engineer, analyst, or  a data scientist. This course covers fundamental SQL concepts, including querying, database design, and data manipulation. learning to extract insights and support data-driven decision-making.

By the end of the course, you will be writing complex queries, optimizing database performance, and using SQL to solve practical problems.

## Grades

Grades have been added to help break your journy into helpful sections. Each section will cover different skill levels and will help you demonstrate your ability to other people.

### Grade 1: Introduction to SQL and Databases

- [**Overview of SQL**](Docs/Grade_1/What_IS_SQL.md): What is SQL, history, and its importance.

* [**Relational Databases**](Docs/Grade_1/Relational_databases.md): Basic concepts of relational databases, tables, rows, and columns.
