## SQL 101 Course Outline

### Level 1: Introduction to SQL and Databases
- **Overview of SQL**: What is SQL, history, and its importance.
- **Relational Databases**: Basic concepts of relational databases, tables, rows, and columns.
- **Basic SQL Syntax**: Introduction to SQL statements and query structure.
- **Simple Queries**: Using `SELECT` to retrieve data from a single table.
- **Filtering Data**: Using `WHERE` clause to filter results.

### Level 2: Intermediate Data Retrieval
- **Sorting Data**: Using `ORDER BY` to sort query results.
- **Limiting Results**: Using `LIMIT` (or `TOP` in some SQL dialects) to restrict the number of returned rows.
- **Basic Functions**: Introduction to SQL functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.
- **Aliasing**: Using `AS` to rename columns in the result set.

### Level 3: Advanced Data Retrieval
- **Joins**: Understanding and using different types of joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`).
- **Aggregate Functions**: Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and filtering groups with `HAVING`.
- **Subqueries**: Writing and using subqueries in `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and `HAVING` clauses.
- **Set Operations**: Using `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.

### Level 4: Data Manipulation
- **Inserting Data**: Using `INSERT` to add new records to a table.
- **Updating Data**: Using `UPDATE` to modify existing records.
- **Deleting Data**: Using `DELETE` to remove records.
- **Bulk Operations**: Performing bulk inserts, updates, and deletes.

### Level 5: Database Design and Data Definition
- **Creating Tables**: Using `CREATE TABLE` to define new tables.
- **Altering Tables**: Using `ALTER TABLE` to modify existing tables (e.g., adding, dropping columns).
- **Dropping Tables**: Using `DROP TABLE` to delete tables.
- **Constraints**: Understanding and implementing primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.

### Level 6: Advanced SQL Functions and Expressions
- **String Functions**: Using functions like `CONCAT`, `SUBSTRING`, `LENGTH`, `TRIM`, etc.
- **Date and Time Functions**: Using functions like `NOW`, `DATEADD`, `DATEDIFF`, `FORMAT`, etc.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Using functions like `ROUND`, `ABS`, `CEIL`, `FLOOR`, etc.
- **Case Statements**: Using `CASE` for conditional logic within queries.

### Level 7: Performance Tuning and Optimization
- **Indexes**: Understanding the importance of indexes and how to create them.
- **Query Optimization**: Tips and techniques for writing efficient queries.
- **Execution Plans**: Reading and interpreting execution plans to optimize query performance.
- **Temporary Tables and CTEs**: Using temporary tables and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex queries.

### Level 8: Transactions and Security
- **Transactions**: Using `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` to manage transactions.
- **Locking and Concurrency**: Understanding locking mechanisms and how to handle concurrency.
- **User Management**: Creating and managing users, roles, and permissions.
- **Security Best Practices**: Implementing best practices for securing SQL databases, including SQL injection prevention.
